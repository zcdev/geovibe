# GeoVibe

**Get the <em>vibe</em> of your state.**

GeoVibe lets you explore U.S. Census data to better understand the population, income, age, and diversity across all 50 states.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [https://geovibe.vercel.app](https://geovibe.vercel.app)

## Overview

GeoVibe is a single-page application that displays demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Users can enter the name of any U.S. state at the form to view statistics on population, median income, age distribution, gender breakdown, and racial diversity.

The project is a complete rebuild of an [earlier JavaScript-based version](https://github.com/zcdev/GeoVibe-old), modernized now using React and Vite. It’s designed to be simple, responsive, and accessible to make geodemographic insights approachable for everyday users.

The custom background artwork was also designed specifically for this app to reflect the theme of diversity, community, and geography.
